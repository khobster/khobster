- 👋 Hi, I’m @khobster
- 👀 I’m interested in the colors on an ABA basketball, Pinter plays, spurs and how they jingle jangle, pretzels bathed in onions and mustard, the Ben Franklin effect, and the downswing and backswing of a swinging tempo.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, python, SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple games like trivia games, arcade games.
- 📫 How to reach me send me a message on here.
